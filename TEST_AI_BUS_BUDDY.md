## 🎯 **Sample Test Conversation**

```
You: "Hello"
AI: "Hello! I'm your AI commute assistant. I see you typically take 
route 335E from Kengeri to Whitefield on weekdays around 8:30 AM. 
How can I help you today?"

You: "Should I leave now?"
AI: "Based on the current time (8:15 AM on Wednesday) and your typical 
pattern, I recommend leaving in about 10 minutes at 8:25 AM. Here's why:
- Current crowd prediction: 50% (Low-Medium)
- Weather is clear (28°C, no rain)
- You typically leave at 8:30 AM
- This gives you 5 minutes buffer
Would you like me to suggest alternative times or routes?"

You: "What about rain?"
AI: "Good question! Currently there's no rain, but let me check the 
forecast... [analyzes weather data]... Light rain is predicted around 
2 PM today. For your evening commute, I recommend:
1. Route 335E (your usual) - has some covered stops
2. Route 500C - has 80% covered stops (recommended if rain is heavy)
Would you like me to send you a reminder closer to your evening commute?"
