# üîß Fix: Database Connection Error

## The Problem
You got this error:
```
‚ùå Migration failed: SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string
```

This means the `.env` file is not set up correctly!

---

## ‚úÖ Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create .env File

**In the `backend/` folder**, create a file named `.env` (no .txt, just `.env`)

**Copy this into it:**

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=whereismybus
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword

REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

JWT_SECRET=my_super_secret_jwt_key_change_in_production
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=my_refresh_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRE=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=7d
```

### Step 2: Update Your Password

**IMPORTANT:** Change `DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword` to your actual PostgreSQL password!

Example:
```env
DB_PASSWORD=admin123
```

### Step 3: Save the File

Make sure:
- File is named `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
- It's in the `backend/` folder
- Password has NO quotes, NO spaces

## üö® Still Not Working?

### Error: "File .env not found"
- Make sure file is in `backend/` folder
- Make sure it's named `.env` (not `.env.txt`)

### Error: "password authentication failed"
- Your PostgreSQL password is wrong
- Remember the password you set during PostgreSQL installation
- Try connecting with pgAdmin to verify password

### Forgot PostgreSQL Password?
1. Open pgAdmin 4
2. Connect to database
3. If you can connect in pgAdmin, use that password
4. If you can't, you need to reset PostgreSQL password
